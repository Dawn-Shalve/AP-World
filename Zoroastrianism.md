Zoroastrianism was founded by the Persion propher Zoroaster. (Nobody is sure when the Religion was fround but some estimate it was around 6000 B.C.)

Zoroaster was born west of Iran in Takht-e-Suleman in the district of Azerbaijan. Zoroaster was the greatest propher among the ancient Iranians.

When Musim Arabs invaded Persia in 650 CE, a small number of Zoroastrians fled to India where most are concentrated today.
